# Python-Challenge

04Apr2021

I had updated main.py multiple times in order to make sure the script and calculations worked. I then experimented with using lists, dictionaries, and functions and updated main.py accordingly. I added one to handle the calculations and used main.py for all of the printing, csv loading, and function calling.
