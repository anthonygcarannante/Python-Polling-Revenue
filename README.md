# Python-Challenge

This repository is to showcase my python skills for creating basic applications that involve using python libraries and general programming concepts.

Technologies Used: VSCode, Python (Dictionaries, Lists, For Loops, CSV Read/Write, OS)

The PyPoll directory has a main.py file that reads in a csv file of simulated voter data and uses programming and mathematical functions to loop through the data, process it, and organize it by candidate. The data is stored initially in a dictionary and then sorted into specific lists for data such as vote counts, candidate names, etc. The final results are printed both as an output of the main.py script and as a text file with the appropriate formatting for viewing purposes.

The PyBank directory also has a main.py file that read in a csv file of a company's revenue over an unknown time period. The main.py script sorts through the data from the csv file to calculate the number of months recorded, the total revenue, teh average change in revenue per month, and the greatest increase & decrease in profits. These are stored in lists. The final results are printed both as an output of the main.py script and as a text file with the appropriate formatting for viewing purposes.
